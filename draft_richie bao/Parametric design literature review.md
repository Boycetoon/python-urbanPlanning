# 参数化设计方法综述与启示（rough draft）

### 参数化/设计(parametric/ design)

As designers, we struggle primarily with interface of the traditional syntax of code/computation. These traditional programming interfaces, such as coding in C# or Fortran, or even scripting in Python, have not yet operated at a level of abstraction designers are accustomed to thinking. Designers have had to rely on a team of computational experts attempting to translate the designer’s language into computer code (scripting). Much can be lost in the translation. However, with developments in GUI (graphic user interfaces) such as Grasshopper software (plug-ins), a huge barrier has been crossed.[1-2] 

As designers, we struggle primarily with interface of the traditional syntax of code/computation. These traditional programming interfaces, such as coding in C# or Fortran, or even scripting in Python, have not yet operated at a level of abstraction designers are accustomed to thinking. Designers have had to rely on a team of computational experts attempting to translate the designer’s language into computer code (scripting). Much can be lost in the translation. However, with developments in GUI (graphic user interfaces) such as Grasshopper software (plug-ins), a huge barrier has been crossed.[1-2]

GUI-based scripting engines such as Grasshopper, Dynamo, Kismet, and Marionette have all become a contemporary phenomenon, opening up new computational vistas to designers who would simply not have bothered to cross the learning barrier to entry in text-based coding editors. [1-2]

These coding and scripting abstraction/ interface platforms have acted as a gateway for many designers, who expanded their reach to numerous problems and data sets in the emerging technological world. Grasshopper, for example, initially launched by McNeel and Associates and created by programmer David Rutten,40 was built upon, after its creation, by numerous add-ons, plug-ins, or extensions (e.g., Rhinoceros). With the built-in script in the background, designers could now engage in parametric design, skipping over the tedious and discouraging scripting, undeterred by the computational demands of the past. Moreover, designers could now concentrate on their work, instead of spending time learning and acquiring computational tools to get to the task. The simplicity with which Grasshopper and Rhino could be utilized led to widespread use of the software across top architectural firms and eventually landscape architecture offices, opening the computational world.41 [1-2]

The success of the software was largely due to Robert McNeel’s insight: “Writing code is not something designers really want to get their head into.” His “business model” had a two-pronged approach: “designers set up sophisticated relationships between the parts of the design problem” and, in addition, the company would make the software available for free during the development process, benefitting from the input of users worldwide.42 Although a small firm by comparison, without the deep pockets of a Dassault Systèmes or Autodesk, by 2009 McNeel reported having 250,000 Rhino users worldwide, among them 50,000 in the field of architecture. This number has since bourgeoned further, as Rhino became commonplace in architectural offices and urban design practices.43[1-2]

In the field of architecture, the virtual wall beyond software and databased design has already been pierced,[1-2]

A new generation of digital natives have been brought up by the new interactive normalcy to live, work, and create abstractly through these virtual media. Machine learning and script definition of software are assisting to fill in the gaps of the executable details of our creative process. The executable interface is now rapidly evolving. It is accessible for designers to “code” problems at the highest levels of abstraction through gesture and real-time feedback, all while designers observe the instantaneous impact of their digital interaction on the built environment.49[1-2]

However, even though the more geometrically “simple” in design and process are easier to calculate through computational design, why do we see this technology being so often only used and advertised in the most abstract or biomorphic of projects? It is certainly refreshing to see these tools used as an enabler or inspiration for complex and new ways of design thinking. However, we must also take advantage of the day-to-day problem-solving capabilities and practical use of such computation engines.[1-2]

We describe, perhaps in a negative tone, the common perceptions and prevailing uses of Grasshopper and other parametric engines to hopefully draw the reader’s attention to a new platform of thinking about computational design and technology in landscape architecture. Software, such as Grasshopper or Dynamo, must be recognized as problem-solving tools and engines of creativity. These tools are not simply engines of graphic communication that perhaps a new generation of design professionals may have mistakenly interpreted and represented as a means to an end in itself. Rather, parametric tools, such as Grasshopper, are practical instruments with the potential to address problems and find solutions while unleashing a vast source of creativity. For example, graduate students used:[1-2]

Emerging from the most ancient of traditions in design and architecture, our obsession with geometry and form are driven by mathematical relationships that are both discreet and subliminal. Grasshopper, Dynamo, and Python are some of the first conversation openers in computational design today, yet it is specifically their abstraction of and thus accessibility to computation that have driven their remarkable success.[1-2]

Many designers will not engage at the high level of syntactical knowledge necessary for scripting given time constraints as one of significant barriers. However, Grasshopper, Rhino, other GUI-based scripting allows designers to more readily connect the outcome of code with the formal representation without having to know how to write code. [1-2]

The world-renowned architect Bjarke Ingels, in his 2013 interview, “Inside the Business of Design,” described the impact of Grasshopper and visual scripting on architecture in these simple terms: “Grasshopper is to parametric scripting what Windows and Macintosh were to the graphical interface for personal computing.” Ingels describes the essence of GUI-based parametric design as follows: “Scripting came from being this incredibly difficult thing in architecture to, at least, I can understand the principles. You basically construct incredibly complex formulas by graphically combining different variables with little wires almost like a switch board.”53[1-2]

### 编程代码(coding/code/codify)
the word “coding” is much more recent; it appeared in the 1950s, when source codes were punched out of cards and then fed into Univac computers that transcribed them into either words or complex binary numerals. The punch cards were not made of waxed tree bark but of cardboard, a derivative of wood, and it is
interesting to note how this original organic link to etched wood prevailed well into the early coding years of the cybernetic age.[1-1]

Using these artificial languages, one can define algorithms – one class of algorithms is those written in computer code.[1-2]

the discussion of “code” as a syntactical language and heuristic process that we push for computational design to become a subject of thought and common language in landscape architecture, to promote new ecological, social, economic, formal, and material design systems in the built environment.[1-2]

However, just as with electronic compilers (translators), in landscape architecture we still struggle with the translation and abstraction of thought processes to machine language.[1-2]

Not all landscape architects will become avid coders. However, it is imperative as a profession agitating for creativity, exploration, innovation, and substantial investment in form generation and alteration of the urban realm that we understand and communicate with those shaping the future components of the synthetic urban construct.[1-2]

### 计算性设计（computational design） 
The extraordinary palette of possibilities offered by new computational methods through geographically positioned modeling and its attributes will enable designers to access more readily a broader palette of options, questions, and solutions, responding physically and spatially to the specificity and inherent complexity of a place. This will also enable an entirely new form of ecology to arise and succeed, one that is much more imbedded in the cultural and topographical quality of each place.[1-1]

The foundation of the modern computer was soundly established by a British mathematician and scientist, Alan Turing, in 1937 in his seminal paper on “Computable Numbers.”5 Apple’s Steve Wozniak believed that Turing set the standards for modern computation: in his keynote address to the 2012 Turing Festival, Wozniak said that “Turing came up with what we know about computers today.”6[1-2]

For Turing’s contemporaries, computation, or computing, meant getting as many people as necessary to complete a task in as short a space of time as was possible. The use of a machine to complete human tasks was a new concept of the time, one society still struggles with in new ways in contemporary culture. Much of Turing’s work investigated the potential of what could be computed by machines in place of their human counterparts.8[1-2]

The origins of computation, from our perspective as designers and planners,emerged first in the 1960s with new thought processes in analysis and environmental planning. This approach is perhaps best explained in 1967 in the seminal paper “Design with Nature,” by Ian McHarg, an approach now referred to as “McHargian Analysis.” Mcharg’s explanation of an overlay system for land classification, coupled with much of the work done and courses taught by Carl Steinitz at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, established a basis for the development of modern GIS (geographic information systems).12[1-2]

In 1965, Chicago architect and Harvard Graduate School of Design Architecture alum Howard T. Fisher, created the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.[1-2]

Fisher further developed GIS, which spun off a number of computer applications and integrated mapping systems, including tools such as SYMAP (Synagraphic Mapping and Analysis Program), with the ability to print contour maps on a line printer.13[1-2]

Fisher’s pioneering ideas, in turn, inspired Jack Dangermond, then research assistant at the lab from 1968 to 1969, to put these ideas to practical use. Dangermond’s start-up company, ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute), was founded in 1969, focusing on software for land use analysis.14[1-2]

In the early 1970s, computation in landscape architecture focused primarily on a two-dimensional understanding of data and mapping overlay. It was not until the late 1970s that three-dimensional computation expanded,[1-2]

The first commercially accessible computers for the masses expanded rapidly in the 1980s, and with that hardware expansion software development would soon follow at an ever-increasing rate. In 1982, Autodesk,founded by John Walker, launched its first version of AutoCAD.20 AutoCAD, to this day, is one of the most heavily used programs for detailed design and drafting in landscape architecture and other design and engineering fields. That same year, Dangermond’s ESRI finally launched Arc/INFO, its first commercially available GIS platform. Arc/INFO remains the leader in large-scale planning and analysis work in landscape architecture.21 Both of these tools, from their early creation, have been dominant in their use in the landscape architecture profession for the last 35 years.[1-2]

Only recently have the detailed drafting and 3D world of CAD (computer-aided design) and the analysis and large-scale data platform of GIS truly started to merge in the software approach of “geo-design.” Perhaps popularized through the first geo-design summit in January 2010, the ideas of geodesign codify the challenges in scale and complexity of landscape computing when shifting scales of models are required from regional ecologies, to civic spaces, to the visual presence of the virtual “wild.”22[1-2]

Within the last decade, with the increase of computational efficiency, we find new models that more directly take advantage of the power of computation to build relationships and form new heuristic models in landscape architecture.[1-2]

The coding of the environment implies a classification, the abstraction of physical and environmental phenomena to create a model that may be used for representation, analysis, or simulation. Design models, visual and/or numerical, describe the world and are the essential fodder through which designers develop design solutions. The continual construction, evolution, and maintenance of these models mediates and develops our relationships between the physical and virtual, underlying our assumptions of the physical world.[1-2]

As our world becomes increasingly algorithmic, we must be aware that technological data usage does not simply become a reflection of privatized mobile/social media data mining, which, while a powerful tool and offering exciting new opportunities in urban planning, does have its limitations in data reliability or sample set.[1-2]

As landscape architects have engaged in the previous decades with GIS, geo-design,and mobile data, we have garnished great rewards in being accumulators of some rather large data sets of physical topography, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic distribution. However, the gathering of data (the inventory) and understanding the algorithms controlling, sorting, or processing that information (the analysis) present the next stage of untold value for the potential of social, formal, materialistic, and environmental models that are more synthetic and controlled by the designer’s intent. This is explored in essay 01.04, “Big Data for Small Places.”[1-2]

Landscape architects are already “embracing digital media as a tool with analytic, performative, and representational possibilities.” The computer is no longer the rival.36 In a dramatic shift, the profession is rapidly moving beyond computation as a design representation medium; the tool is now influencing the thinking process of the landscape architect to shape dynamic models for adaptive and responsive landscapes.37[1-2]

the influence with which computation and the computationally minded will shape our built environment is without question.[1-2]

It may appear that the complexity of the world around us is increasing in the human ability to interact and control our surrounding everyday objects. In reality, we are seeing an increasing translation from mechanical to digital (coded) language within our daily lives.[1-2]

### 复杂系统（complex system）

### 算法（algorithm）
Not understanding these algorithms, the language (codes) these instructions are written in makes the objects appear more complicated—when in reality they are simply more complicated in a digital sphere than in a physical or mechanical interaction.[1-2]


### 生成设计（generative design/modeling）

### 进化（evolution）

### 代理模型（agent-based model）

our cities’ future is largely influenced by a third group composed of landscape architects, architects, urban planners, and engineers. These “technocrats” are shaping the physical cities and environments within which future technologies and innovations must be integrated. They must anticipate and create “space” for a future that no one can define.[1-2]

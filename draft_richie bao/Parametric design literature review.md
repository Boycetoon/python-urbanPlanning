# 参数化设计方法综述与启示（rough draft）

## 相关概念及关系
* 参数化/设计(parametric/ design)

*  编程代码(coding/code/codify)

the word “coding” is much more recent; it appeared in the 1950s, when source codes were punched out of cards and then fed into Univac computers that transcribed them into either words or complex binary numerals. The punch cards were not made of waxed tree bark but of cardboard, a derivative of wood, and it is
interesting to note how this original organic link to etched wood prevailed well into the early coding years of the cybernetic age.[1-1]

* 计算性设计（computational design） 

The extraordinary palette of possibilities offered by new computational methods through geographically positioned modeling and its attributes will enable designers to access more readily a broader palette of options, questions, and solutions, responding physically and spatially to the specificity and inherent complexity of a place. This will also enable an entirely new form of ecology to arise and succeed, one that is much more imbedded in the cultural and topographical quality of each place.[1-1]

* 复杂系统（complex system）

* 算法（algorithm）

* 生成设计（generative design/modeling）

* 进化（evolution）

* 代理模型（agent-based model）

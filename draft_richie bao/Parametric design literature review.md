# 参数化设计方法综述与启示（rough draft）

## 相关概念及关系
* 参数化/设计(parametric/ design)

*  编程代码(coding/code/codify)

the word “coding” is much more recent; it appeared in the 1950s, when source codes were punched out of cards and then fed into Univac computers that transcribed them into either words or complex binary numerals. The punch cards were not made of waxed tree bark but of cardboard, a derivative of wood, and it is
interesting to note how this original organic link to etched wood prevailed well into the early coding years of the cybernetic age.[1-1]

Using these artificial languages, one can define algorithms – one class of algorithms is those written in computer code.[1-2]

the discussion of “code” as a syntactical language and heuristic process that we push for computational design to become a subject of thought and common language in landscape architecture, to promote new ecological, social, economic, formal, and material design systems in the built environment.[1-2]

However, just as with electronic compilers (translators), in landscape architecture we still struggle with the translation and abstraction of thought processes to machine language.[1-2]

* 计算性设计（computational design） 

The extraordinary palette of possibilities offered by new computational methods through geographically positioned modeling and its attributes will enable designers to access more readily a broader palette of options, questions, and solutions, responding physically and spatially to the specificity and inherent complexity of a place. This will also enable an entirely new form of ecology to arise and succeed, one that is much more imbedded in the cultural and topographical quality of each place.[1-1]

The foundation of the modern computer was soundly established by a British mathematician and scientist, Alan Turing, in 1937 in his seminal paper on “Computable Numbers.”5 Apple’s Steve Wozniak believed that Turing set the standards for modern computation: in his keynote address to the 2012 Turing Festival, Wozniak said that “Turing came up with what we know about computers today.”6[1-2]

For Turing’s contemporaries, computation, or computing, meant getting as many people as necessary to complete a task in as short a space of time as was possible. The use of a machine to complete human tasks was a new concept of the time, one society still struggles with in new ways in contemporary culture. Much of Turing’s work investigated the potential of what could be computed by machines in place of their human counterparts.8[1-2]

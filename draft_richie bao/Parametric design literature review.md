### 参数化/设计(parametric/ design)
#### grasshopper
As designers, we struggle primarily with interface of the traditional syntax of code/computation. These traditional programming interfaces, such as coding in C# or Fortran, or even scripting in Python, have not yet operated at a level of abstraction designers are accustomed to thinking. Designers have had to rely on a team of computational experts attempting to translate the designer’s language into computer code (scripting). Much can be lost in the translation. However, with developments in GUI (graphic user interfaces) such as Grasshopper software (plug-ins), a huge barrier has been crossed.[1-2] 

As designers, we struggle primarily with interface of the traditional syntax of code/computation. These traditional programming interfaces, such as coding in C# or Fortran, or even scripting in Python, have not yet operated at a level of abstraction designers are accustomed to thinking. Designers have had to rely on a team of computational experts attempting to translate the designer’s language into computer code (scripting). Much can be lost in the translation. However, with developments in GUI (graphic user interfaces) such as Grasshopper software (plug-ins), a huge barrier has been crossed.[1-2]

GUI-based scripting engines such as Grasshopper, Dynamo, Kismet, and Marionette have all become a contemporary phenomenon, opening up new computational vistas to designers who would simply not have bothered to cross the learning barrier to entry in text-based coding editors. [1-2]

These coding and scripting abstraction/ interface platforms have acted as a gateway for many designers, who expanded their reach to numerous problems and data sets in the emerging technological world. Grasshopper, for example, initially launched by McNeel and Associates and created by programmer David Rutten,40 was built upon, after its creation, by numerous add-ons, plug-ins, or extensions (e.g., Rhinoceros). With the built-in script in the background, designers could now engage in parametric design, skipping over the tedious and discouraging scripting, undeterred by the computational demands of the past. Moreover, designers could now concentrate on their work, instead of spending time learning and acquiring computational tools to get to the task. The simplicity with which Grasshopper and Rhino could be utilized led to widespread use of the software across top architectural firms and eventually landscape architecture offices, opening the computational world.41 [1-2]

The success of the software was largely due to Robert McNeel’s insight: “Writing code is not something designers really want to get their head into.” His “business model” had a two-pronged approach: “designers set up sophisticated relationships between the parts of the design problem” and, in addition, the company would make the software available for free during the development process, benefitting from the input of users worldwide.42 Although a small firm by comparison, without the deep pockets of a Dassault Systèmes or Autodesk, by 2009 McNeel reported having 250,000 Rhino users worldwide, among them 50,000 in the field of architecture. This number has since bourgeoned further, as Rhino became commonplace in architectural offices and urban design practices.43[1-2]

In the field of architecture, the virtual wall beyond software and databased design has already been pierced,[1-2]

A new generation of digital natives have been brought up by the new interactive normalcy to live, work, and create abstractly through these virtual media. Machine learning and script definition of software are assisting to fill in the gaps of the executable details of our creative process. The executable interface is now rapidly evolving. It is accessible for designers to “code” problems at the highest levels of abstraction through gesture and real-time feedback, all while designers observe the instantaneous impact of their digital interaction on the built environment.49[1-2]

However, even though the more geometrically “simple” in design and process are easier to calculate through computational design, why do we see this technology being so often only used and advertised in the most abstract or biomorphic of projects? It is certainly refreshing to see these tools used as an enabler or inspiration for complex and new ways of design thinking. However, we must also take advantage of the day-to-day problem-solving capabilities and practical use of such computation engines.[1-2]

We describe, perhaps in a negative tone, the common perceptions and prevailing uses of Grasshopper and other parametric engines to hopefully draw the reader’s attention to a new platform of thinking about computational design and technology in landscape architecture. Software, such as Grasshopper or Dynamo, must be recognized as problem-solving tools and engines of creativity. These tools are not simply engines of graphic communication that perhaps a new generation of design professionals may have mistakenly interpreted and represented as a means to an end in itself. Rather, parametric tools, such as Grasshopper, are practical instruments with the potential to address problems and find solutions while unleashing a vast source of creativity. For example, graduate students used:[1-2]

Emerging from the most ancient of traditions in design and architecture, our obsession with geometry and form are driven by mathematical relationships that are both discreet and subliminal. Grasshopper, Dynamo, and Python are some of the first conversation openers in computational design today, yet it is specifically their abstraction of and thus accessibility to computation that have driven their remarkable success.[1-2]

Many designers will not engage at the high level of syntactical knowledge necessary for scripting given time constraints as one of significant barriers. However, Grasshopper, Rhino, other GUI-based scripting allows designers to more readily connect the outcome of code with the formal representation without having to know how to write code. [1-2]

The world-renowned architect Bjarke Ingels, in his 2013 interview, “Inside the Business of Design,” described the impact of Grasshopper and visual scripting on architecture in these simple terms: “Grasshopper is to parametric scripting what Windows and Macintosh were to the graphical interface for personal computing.” Ingels describes the essence of GUI-based parametric design as follows: “Scripting came from being this incredibly difficult thing in architecture to, at least, I can understand the principles. You basically construct incredibly complex formulas by graphically combining different variables with little wires almost like a switch board.”53[1-2]

The initial design for the park was developed through iterative analog diagramming, which was then replicated and expanded with the use of parametric software.[1-5]

In the initial design phase, these decisions were made through intuitive understanding of the parameters of the site and embedded in an analog rule set that guided design decisions. In further research we have codified the relationship between the spatial logics of the design and the material logics of the tectonic, in a parametric algorithm. [1-5]

Initial research was performed in preparation for the Acadia 2014 exhibition, an annual parametric design conference. The central question was: could the design process, the distribution of points and pathways with a distinct tectonic, be replicated? Further, could other contextual influences and conditions be added, and could the tectonic respond to those conditions? Is the use of responsive parametric definitions scalable and can it be applied to larger linear landscapes such as waterfronts, urbanized rivers, etc.? Grasshopper, a parametric plug-in for the 3D modeling program Rhinoceros, was used to further develop the research. FIGURE 1.3.2 Landscape components and site performance diagrams By implementing the design variables into a parametric system, we intended to utilize the system to display the design resiliency of the tectonic and spatial systems. The decision to codify the analog system, developed in the initial phase of design, was driven by the knowledge that future specification of the design in permitting, coordination, and construction documentation would require multiple iterations responding to new constraints and conditions, as they might arise. [1-5]

Grasshopper was further used, to produce the technical documentation for project construction and permitting. A responsive 3D model was prepared, which integrated the site data, including existing utilities and topography. This model was responsive, in the sense that modifications to simple referenced forms would result in universal modifications throughout the master project model. [1-5]

Grasshopper would convert into the modular tablet paver field. This allowed for the clean export of vectors to 2D CAD with minimal trimming and cleanup.[1-5]

With over 18 feet of grade change on the site, and tight tolerances to achieve and accessible public space, Grasshopper again proved to be a powerful ally.[1-5]

Grasshopper was then used to generate a responsive model for the custom play structure. Like the analog pinboard, this model allowed us to quickly generate multiple versions of the structure. The model would automatically distribute netting, fittings, and play elements, responding to the manipulation of the perimeter and interior tube forms. Running component lists could be generated and output to spreadsheets for cost control and evaluation. Final visualizations of the various iterations could be generated at any time, for community design meetings. [1-5]

typically achieved with pen and paper. It also can lead to unanticipated outcomes. A parametric program can allow for the generation of infinite iterations, some of which may never have been conceived. At times, mistakes made in data entry can lead a designer onto a new path of exploration. Yet it is still up to the designer to make the final call in selecting what is worth further developent. Great design often comes from challenging rules and conventions, from responding to insurmountable constraints with solutions. It also comes from human intellect and experience. Memory, experience, emotion, and humor are not yet parameters that can be input into a parametric definition.[1-5]

#### dynamo
BA: When designing computational tools, some strategies we use to ensure our tools are robust and not subject to failure is to try building them as natively as possible. What do I mean when I say that? There has been this HUGE push to open-source tools (which is amazing), but comes with its own set of challenges. As an example, Dynamo is an open-source program to which the industry can contribute its own custom packages, or add-ins. The challenge when using someone else’s open-source package is that you are now subject to the integrity of their tool. If there is a flaw in their tool, or if it no longer works when a new release of Dynamo comes out, you are now subject to that defect. We prefer to use our own custom nodes, as it gives us greater control over the tool and its integrity.

### 编程代码(coding/code/codify)
the word “coding” is much more recent; it appeared in the 1950s, when source codes were punched out of cards and then fed into Univac computers that transcribed them into either words or complex binary numerals. The punch cards were not made of waxed tree bark but of cardboard, a derivative of wood, and it is
interesting to note how this original organic link to etched wood prevailed well into the early coding years of the cybernetic age.[1-1]

Using these artificial languages, one can define algorithms – one class of algorithms is those written in computer code.[1-2]

the discussion of “code” as a syntactical language and heuristic process that we push for computational design to become a subject of thought and common language in landscape architecture, to promote new ecological, social, economic, formal, and material design systems in the built environment.[1-2]

However, just as with electronic compilers (translators), in landscape architecture we still struggle with the translation and abstraction of thought processes to machine language.[1-2]

Not all landscape architects will become avid coders. However, it is imperative as a profession agitating for creativity, exploration, innovation, and substantial investment in form generation and alteration of the urban realm that we understand and communicate with those shaping the future components of the synthetic urban construct.[1-2]

However, it is imperative as a profession agitating for creativity, exploration, innovation, and substantial investment in form generation and alteration of the urban realm that we understand and communicate with those shaping the future components of the synthetic urban construct.[1-2]

Coding is a common language of creation, iteration, logic, communication, exploration, and innovation for the twenty-first century. [1-2]

A computer program is not a task that someone who knows how to code goes right into and writes simply because they know the language. The program is dependent on a problem to be solved. A programmer must know the logic and sequence of commands intended to be developed. The code is simply the wording telling the computer what to do. That communication ability is vital. [1-2]

### 计算性设计（computational design） 
The extraordinary palette of possibilities offered by new computational methods through geographically positioned modeling and its attributes will enable designers to access more readily a broader palette of options, questions, and solutions, responding physically and spatially to the specificity and inherent complexity of a place. This will also enable an entirely new form of ecology to arise and succeed, one that is much more imbedded in the cultural and topographical quality of each place.[1-1]

The foundation of the modern computer was soundly established by a British mathematician and scientist, Alan Turing, in 1937 in his seminal paper on “Computable Numbers.”5 Apple’s Steve Wozniak believed that Turing set the standards for modern computation: in his keynote address to the 2012 Turing Festival, Wozniak said that “Turing came up with what we know about computers today.”6[1-2]

For Turing’s contemporaries, computation, or computing, meant getting as many people as necessary to complete a task in as short a space of time as was possible. The use of a machine to complete human tasks was a new concept of the time, one society still struggles with in new ways in contemporary culture. Much of Turing’s work investigated the potential of what could be computed by machines in place of their human counterparts.8[1-2]

The origins of computation, from our perspective as designers and planners,emerged first in the 1960s with new thought processes in analysis and environmental planning. This approach is perhaps best explained in 1967 in the seminal paper “Design with Nature,” by Ian McHarg, an approach now referred to as “McHargian Analysis.” Mcharg’s explanation of an overlay system for land classification, coupled with much of the work done and courses taught by Carl Steinitz at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, established a basis for the development of modern GIS (geographic information systems).12[1-2]

In 1965, Chicago architect and Harvard Graduate School of Design Architecture alum Howard T. Fisher, created the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.[1-2]

Fisher further developed GIS, which spun off a number of computer applications and integrated mapping systems, including tools such as SYMAP (Synagraphic Mapping and Analysis Program), with the ability to print contour maps on a line printer.13[1-2]

Fisher’s pioneering ideas, in turn, inspired Jack Dangermond, then research assistant at the lab from 1968 to 1969, to put these ideas to practical use. Dangermond’s start-up company, ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute), was founded in 1969, focusing on software for land use analysis.14[1-2]

In the early 1970s, computation in landscape architecture focused primarily on a two-dimensional understanding of data and mapping overlay. It was not until the late 1970s that three-dimensional computation expanded,[1-2]

The first commercially accessible computers for the masses expanded rapidly in the 1980s, and with that hardware expansion software development would soon follow at an ever-increasing rate. In 1982, Autodesk,founded by John Walker, launched its first version of AutoCAD.20 AutoCAD, to this day, is one of the most heavily used programs for detailed design and drafting in landscape architecture and other design and engineering fields. That same year, Dangermond’s ESRI finally launched Arc/INFO, its first commercially available GIS platform. Arc/INFO remains the leader in large-scale planning and analysis work in landscape architecture.21 Both of these tools, from their early creation, have been dominant in their use in the landscape architecture profession for the last 35 years.[1-2]

Only recently have the detailed drafting and 3D world of CAD (computer-aided design) and the analysis and large-scale data platform of GIS truly started to merge in the software approach of “geo-design.” Perhaps popularized through the first geo-design summit in January 2010, the ideas of geodesign codify the challenges in scale and complexity of landscape computing when shifting scales of models are required from regional ecologies, to civic spaces, to the visual presence of the virtual “wild.”22[1-2]

Within the last decade, with the increase of computational efficiency, we find new models that more directly take advantage of the power of computation to build relationships and form new heuristic models in landscape architecture.[1-2]

The coding of the environment implies a classification, the abstraction of physical and environmental phenomena to create a model that may be used for representation, analysis, or simulation. Design models, visual and/or numerical, describe the world and are the essential fodder through which designers develop design solutions. The continual construction, evolution, and maintenance of these models mediates and develops our relationships between the physical and virtual, underlying our assumptions of the physical world.[1-2]

As our world becomes increasingly algorithmic, we must be aware that technological data usage does not simply become a reflection of privatized mobile/social media data mining, which, while a powerful tool and offering exciting new opportunities in urban planning, does have its limitations in data reliability or sample set.[1-2]

As landscape architects have engaged in the previous decades with GIS, geo-design,and mobile data, we have garnished great rewards in being accumulators of some rather large data sets of physical topography, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic distribution. However, the gathering of data (the inventory) and understanding the algorithms controlling, sorting, or processing that information (the analysis) present the next stage of untold value for the potential of social, formal, materialistic, and environmental models that are more synthetic and controlled by the designer’s intent. This is explored in essay 01.04, “Big Data for Small Places.”[1-2]

Landscape architects are already “embracing digital media as a tool with analytic, performative, and representational possibilities.” The computer is no longer the rival.36 In a dramatic shift, the profession is rapidly moving beyond computation as a design representation medium; the tool is now influencing the thinking process of the landscape architect to shape dynamic models for adaptive and responsive landscapes.37[1-2]

the influence with which computation and the computationally minded will shape our built environment is without question.[1-2]

It may appear that the complexity of the world around us is increasing in the human ability to interact and control our surrounding everyday objects. In reality, we are seeing an increasing translation from mechanical to digital (coded) language within our daily lives.[1-2]

One of the greatest struggles we face, as a design profession, is our attempt to overcome what we perceive to be the limitations of technology and computation. That perception is that computation is “only” a tool kit, only a set of operations. We must understand computation as a way of thinking, as a way of linking our thought process and dynamic environments. This is very different from “computerization.”[1-2]

Computerization is a tool kit of prefabricated software that we accept or use within the bounds of what it allows our landscape to be. What we yearn for as a profession is computation. That concept goes far beyond the tool kit. Computational design is the systematic method for critical thinking that emphasizes thought process and iteration over memorization and duplication. It stresses the linking of ideas, and interaction between the parts of the problem and the solution. [1-2]

Computational thinking combines the powerful orderly process of algorithmic organization with the equally powerful, but more chaotic, process of iterative design. Computational design is a way of approaching all the challenges in the world around you in a more visionary, creative, far-reaching, and organized way that is more likely to succeed. We engage with computational decisions each day whether we realize it or not. In the design field the passage beyond computational skills, and tools, albeit influenced by computer thinking, is a paradigm shift: “Steps away from ‘form making’ and toward ‘form finding.’”58[1-2]

The terms “computational design” and “parametric design” can be defined in many ways. They may bring to mind forms driven by generative algorithms or the ability to design with various types of data sets or simply the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) software. We can argue that what the fields of computational design and parametric design hold in terms of potential and capability, they lack in clarity and specificity.[1-3]

A designer that is working parametrically may be thought of as someone who is flipping the traditional process, an editor of constraints first, and an empirical designer once the constraints are designed. What this means for practice is often far more interesting and innovative than the complex forms that initiate such projects. Inherent in the computational design process is the ability to quickly explore multiple design iterations throughout a project. This process is sometimes referred to as “optioneering,” in which consultants and collaborators are brought on early in a design in order to help define the project constraints. As design processes and schedules adapt to emergent modeling and analysis workflows, we find opportunities for new models of practice that simultaneously react to, and influence advances in the field of computational design.[1-3]

First and foremost, there is a general evasion of all-encompassing terms such as “computational design” owing to their vague and abstract nature. Since computational design comes in so many shapes and sizes it is best to describe more specifically what is being offered by these individual practices. In some cases, the focus is on efficiency and precision. In other cases, the focus may be more about achieving a particular level of complexity or in realizing a unique aesthetic. Computational design in and of itself does not possess a style or even a process, but rather provides a broad characterization of a way of thinking through design issues and realizing a project by simply incorporating more layers of information.[1-3]

### 参数化（prametric design）
The roots of understanding computational and parametric design do not lie buried beneath complex mathematical formulas or coding syntax. Instead, they reside in the organization of thoughts and a design approach. When designers understand code and computation in this manner, it is possible to then frame design problems through this lens, opening up a dialogue between design intent and computational iteration and generation.[1-2]

What is not as evident is the logic, the thought process, and the utilization of parametric design that have been applied to bring about the complex execution.[1-2]

It was a feedback loop, where the design drove the code, and the code, in turn, reinfluenced the design.

### 复杂系统（complex system）

### 算法（algorithm）
Not understanding these algorithms, the language (codes) these instructions are written in makes the objects appear more complicated—when in reality they are simply more complicated in a digital sphere than in a physical or mechanical interaction.[1-2]


### 生成设计（generative design/modeling）
Landscape practices have recently been informed by two distinct lines of inquiry. Ecological and environmental concerns have thrust landscape and ecology into the center of design discourse in ways that explore the dynamic, operational, and even physical aspects of ecological systems as a starting point for generating design— whether landscape, building, or urbanism. Simultaneously, advances in software technologies have brought generative and associative modeling tools into the academic design studio and into the professional office, allowing for a new generation of techniques and fabrication technologies to emerge[1-4]

Such modeling techniques, which can be utilized to initiate design inquiry and ultimately generate physical form, allow for a continuous and increasing complexity of inputs to the modeling process, producing a multiplication and elaboration of possibilities that each respond to a slightly different set of priorities or agendas. Thus design is neither static nor compositional, but dynamic; assemblies of forms and components (at any range of scales and serving any number of functions) can be generated from a set of logics that can adapt themselves to circumstances, all the while maintaining their essential characteristics and operational protocols. This is conceptually not so far removed from the work of late twentieth-century ecologists, who emphasized an organism’s or ecosystem’s adaptability in assessing overall health—with the idea that various inputs could produce shifts and changes in the environment over time, and the final physical form of a healthy organism or ecosystem would change and adapt to these new circumstances.1 Multiple outcomes are possible here; physical form is malleable—it is more the functioning and operation of systems that are in play.[1-4]

This essay will examine three scales of the application of associative and generative modeling techniques in the conceptualization and making of performance-based landscape and urban form. At the scale of the human body, recent applications speak to the translation of associative modeling principles and methods into fabrication and construction processes for furnishings and elements, allowing for the generation of nonstandardized and nonrepetitive units that may better serve diverse body types and shapes and differing agendas for how to use public space. Site scale work explores the ways in which hydrology or social program or even desired experiences or relationships can inform the delineation and hybridization of landform, pathway, and gathering space. Subsequent work in both academia and practice test and push this further, with elaborations across the broader urban field, including landscape and infrastructural systems, and the generation of urban form— instigating multiplication and elaboration across large territories in ways that can adapt and adjust to specific conditions on the ground. Underlying all this is a set of dialogues between academic explorations and applications in practice that continue to reverberate and inform one another as the work advances. [1-4]

At the scale of the site, generative modeling can take on increasing levels of complexity in terms of function, program, site conditions, and any other set of technical or experienti criteria. Early studies in the academic design studio explored the various creative relationships between the protocols of remediation technologies, for instance, and the generation of responsive and productive landscape systems. The water treatment process was translated into performative criteria (basin size, flow criteria, duration, and planting and soil conditions) that could then generate a series of clustered basins. These basins could be configured differently in response to existing topographic conditions and underlying drainage patterns, producing a variety of basin configurations that all shared an inherent set of logics and performance protocols. Such early studies were translated in full design studios at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, in which students were asked to create landform systems that would respond to water flows, inundation, and infiltration requirements—and eventually be layered to accommodate various forms of human occupation as well. In all of this, iteration, testing, prototyping, and a level of free and open-ended “play” were all at work; adaptability, and dealing with a level of environmental and human behavioral indeterminacy, came directly into play.[1-4]

From here, it’s an almost simple leap to complex urban systems—systems that include functional infrastructure, social spaces, dynamic landscapes, even building form developed according to environmental performance criteria. In some ways you could think of these advanced urbanistic and social requirements as additional sets of criteria that are plugged into the software. Here urban infrastructure can be figured to respond to advanced hydrologic agendas and adaptive water and ecological networks in the city. Buildings can be carved in response to environmental conditions and optimal sun angles for better environmental performance within the buildings themselves and better quality of public social spaces in between them. Generative systems take on multiple and diverse architectural, infrastructural, landscape, and social agendas—that allow for an almost infinite combination and recombination, testing, and evaluation—and that set up principles and tactics that can adapt responsively to conditions on the ground, administrative decisions, and evolving circumstances.[1-4]

our cities’ future is largely influenced by a third group composed of landscape architects, architects, urban planners, and engineers. These “technocrats” are shaping the physical cities and environments within which future technologies and innovations must be integrated. They must anticipate and create “space” for a future that no one can define.[1-2]

They must anticipate and create “space” for a future that no one can define. [1-2]

At present scripters tend to be of the “lone gun” mentality and are justifiably proud of their firepower, usually developed through many late nights of obsessive concentration. There is a danger that if celebration of skills is allowed to obscure and divert from the real design objectives, then scripting degenerates to become an isolated craft rather than developing into an integrated art form.

The transition will be a complex evolution from “static” built/urban environments to “dynamic” self-constructing, living, breathing, and even artificially intelligent (thinking) environments.[1-2]

What our new computational media and new methods of construction allow is a fundamental bridge between design idea and physical reality. The connection of the virtual and physical model in space can now exist in direct mirror or alternate reality of each other, as opposed to the cumbersome two-dimensional abstraction of orthographic drawings and measured scales.[1-2]

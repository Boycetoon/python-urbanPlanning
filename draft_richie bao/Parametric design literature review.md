# 参数化设计方法综述与启示（rough draft）

## 相关概念及关系
### 参数化/设计(parametric/ design)

### 编程代码(coding/code/codify)

the word “coding” is much more recent; it appeared in the 1950s, when source codes were punched out of cards and then fed into Univac computers that transcribed them into either words or complex binary numerals. The punch cards were not made of waxed tree bark but of cardboard, a derivative of wood, and it is
interesting to note how this original organic link to etched wood prevailed well into the early coding years of the cybernetic age.[1-1]

Using these artificial languages, one can define algorithms – one class of algorithms is those written in computer code.[1-2]

the discussion of “code” as a syntactical language and heuristic process that we push for computational design to become a subject of thought and common language in landscape architecture, to promote new ecological, social, economic, formal, and material design systems in the built environment.[1-2]

However, just as with electronic compilers (translators), in landscape architecture we still struggle with the translation and abstraction of thought processes to machine language.[1-2]



### 计算性设计（computational design） 

The extraordinary palette of possibilities offered by new computational methods through geographically positioned modeling and its attributes will enable designers to access more readily a broader palette of options, questions, and solutions, responding physically and spatially to the specificity and inherent complexity of a place. This will also enable an entirely new form of ecology to arise and succeed, one that is much more imbedded in the cultural and topographical quality of each place.[1-1]

The foundation of the modern computer was soundly established by a British mathematician and scientist, Alan Turing, in 1937 in his seminal paper on “Computable Numbers.”5 Apple’s Steve Wozniak believed that Turing set the standards for modern computation: in his keynote address to the 2012 Turing Festival, Wozniak said that “Turing came up with what we know about computers today.”6[1-2]

For Turing’s contemporaries, computation, or computing, meant getting as many people as necessary to complete a task in as short a space of time as was possible. The use of a machine to complete human tasks was a new concept of the time, one society still struggles with in new ways in contemporary culture. Much of Turing’s work investigated the potential of what could be computed by machines in place of their human counterparts.8[1-2]

The origins of computation, from our perspective as designers and planners,emerged first in the 1960s with new thought processes in analysis and environmental planning. This approach is perhaps best explained in 1967 in the seminal paper “Design with Nature,” by Ian McHarg, an approach now referred to as “McHargian Analysis.” Mcharg’s explanation of an overlay system for land classification, coupled with much of the work done and courses taught by Carl Steinitz at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, established a basis for the development of modern GIS (geographic information systems).12[1-2]

In 1965, Chicago architect and Harvard Graduate School of Design Architecture alum Howard T. Fisher, created the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis.[1-2]

Fisher further developed GIS, which spun off a number of computer applications and integrated mapping systems, including tools such as SYMAP (Synagraphic Mapping and Analysis Program), with the ability to print contour maps on a line printer.13[1-2]

Fisher’s pioneering ideas, in turn, inspired Jack Dangermond, then research assistant at the lab from 1968 to 1969, to put these ideas to practical use. Dangermond’s start-up company, ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute), was founded in 1969, focusing on software for land use analysis.14[1-2]

In the early 1970s, computation in landscape architecture focused primarily on a two-dimensional understanding of data and mapping overlay. It was not until the late 1970s that three-dimensional computation expanded,[1-2]

The first commercially accessible computers for the masses expanded rapidly in the 1980s, and with that hardware expansion software development would soon follow at an ever-increasing rate. In 1982, Autodesk,founded by John Walker, launched its first version of AutoCAD.20 AutoCAD, to this day, is one of the most heavily used programs for detailed design and drafting in landscape architecture and other design and engineering fields. That same year, Dangermond’s ESRI finally launched Arc/INFO, its first commercially available GIS platform. Arc/INFO remains the leader in large-scale planning and analysis work in landscape architecture.21 Both of these tools, from their early creation, have been dominant in their use in the landscape architecture profession for the last 35 years.[1-2]

Only recently have the detailed drafting and 3D world of CAD (computer-aided design) and the analysis and large-scale data platform of GIS truly started to merge in the software approach of “geo-design.” Perhaps popularized through the first geo-design summit in January 2010, the ideas of geodesign codify the challenges in scale and complexity of landscape computing when shifting scales of models are required from regional ecologies, to civic spaces, to the visual presence of the virtual “wild.”22[1-2]

Within the last decade, with the increase of computational efficiency, we find new models that more directly take advantage of the power of computation to build relationships and form new heuristic models in landscape architecture.[1-2]

The coding of the environment implies a classification, the abstraction of physical and environmental phenomena to create a model that may be used for representation, analysis, or simulation. Design models, visual and/or numerical, describe the world and are the essential fodder through which designers develop design solutions. The continual construction, evolution, and maintenance of these models mediates and develops our relationships between the physical and virtual, underlying our assumptions of the physical world.[1-2]

As our world becomes increasingly algorithmic, we must be aware that technological data usage does not simply become a reflection of privatized mobile/social media data mining, which, while a powerful tool and offering exciting new opportunities in urban planning, does have its limitations in data reliability or sample set.[1-2]

As landscape architects have engaged in the previous decades with GIS, geo-design,and mobile data, we have garnished great rewards in being accumulators of some rather large data sets of physical topography, sea-level rise, and socioeconomic distribution. However, the gathering of data (the inventory) and understanding the algorithms controlling, sorting, or processing that information (the analysis) present the next stage of untold value for the potential of social, formal, materialistic, and environmental models that are more synthetic and controlled by the designer’s intent. This is explored in essay 01.04, “Big Data for Small Places.”[1-2]
